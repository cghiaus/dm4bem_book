# Summary

ABSTRACT. State-space representation is a widely used in the synthesis and analysis of dynamic systems, with applications particularly in control engineering. However, existing simulation tools often do not find the state-space representation. Dynamic Models for Building Energy Management (dm4bem) is a Python module that offers an innovative methodology for modelling heat and mass transfer using weighted directed graphs, also known as thermal circuits or networks. The methodology allows assembling the circuits to obtain complex models from constituent elements, and then transforming them into state-space representation. This representation provides several advantages, including the ability to analyse the eigenvalues of the transfer matrix, perform numerical integration for simulation, and synthesize control algorithms. Furthermore, the nonlinear models can be dealt with through linearization at each time step. This procedure is presented in the form of an interactive book in which the code can be tested online. The code and tutorials are available in this Jupyter book.
