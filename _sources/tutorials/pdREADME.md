# State-space models by using PandasThe [workflow](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Workflow) for thermal analysis by using `dm4bem` module is presented in figure 1: - Model:      - obtain dissasembled thermal circuit from files describing the walls and the thermal circuits (function `bldg2TCd()`);     - assemble the thermal circuits (functions `assemble_TCd_matrix()` and `assemble_lists2matrix()`);     - state-space representation from thermal circuit (function `tc2ss()`).- Inputs:    - get weather data: outdoor temperature and direct, diffuse and reflected solar radiation on tilted surfaces (functions `read_epw()` and `sol_rad_tilt_surf()`);    - define the other inputs, such as indoor temperature set points, auxialiry flow-rates;- Simulation:    - prepare the inputs from input description of the state-space  ($u_s$) and the _input data set_ (function `inputs_in_time()`);    - integrate in time by using Euler explicit and implicit methods.![work_flow](../figures/pd_work_flow.svg)> Figure 1.
