Developing control algorithms requires dynamic models of the processes. This Jupyter Book explores the modeling of thermal transfer in buildings through thermal networks. It outlines the construction of elementary thermal networks and their assembly to create the thermal network of complex systems, such as a building, by using `dm4bem` module written in _Python 3.9_. Additionally, it presents the transformation of these thermal networks into state-space representation, which can then serve for simulations, as demonstrated here. This book does not cover the development of control algorithms.

__Quick overview__

The workflow is presented in the Jupyter Notebook on [inputs and simulation](tutorials/pd05simulation.ipynb).

__Prerequisites__

It is assumed that readers possess an undergraduate-level understanding of linear algebra, heat transfer, and programming in Python.

__Values of quantities__

This book uses the writing conventions for SI unit symbols and names recommanded by the *International Bureau of Weights and Measures* ([BIPM 2019](https://www.bipm.org/documents/20126/41483022/SI-Brochure-9-EN.pdf/2d2b50bf-f2b4-9661-f402-5f9d66e4b507?version=1.11&t=1671101192839&download=true), [Gőbel et al. 2006](https://www.bipm.org/documents/20126/41483022/SI-Brochure-9-concise-EN.pdf/2fda4656-e236-0fcb-3867-36ca74eea4e3)) and *National Institute of Standards and Technology* ([Thomson A. et al. 2008](https://nvlpubs.nist.gov/nistpubs/Legacy/SP/nistspecialpublication811e2008.pdf)).
