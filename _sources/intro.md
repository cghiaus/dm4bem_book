The development of control algorithms requires dynamic models of processes. This Jupyter Book explores the modeling of thermal transfer in buildings through thermal networks. It outlines the construction of elementary thermal networks and their assembly to create the thermal network of complex systems, such as a building. Additionally, it presents the transformation of these thermal networks into state-space representation which can then serve for simulations, as demonstrated here. This book does not cover the development of control algorithms.

To follow the contents of this book, it is assumed that readers possess an undergraduate-level understanding of linear algebra, heat transfer, and programming in Python.

This book uses the writing conventions for unit symbols and names recommanded by the *International Bureau of Weights and Measures* ([BIPM 2019](https://www.bipm.org/documents/20126/41483022/SI-Brochure-9-EN.pdf/2d2b50bf-f2b4-9661-f402-5f9d66e4b507?version=1.11&t=1671101192839&download=true)) and *National Institute of Standards and Technology* ([Thomson A. et al. 2008](https://nvlpubs.nist.gov/nistpubs/Legacy/SP/nistspecialpublication811e2008.pdf)).
